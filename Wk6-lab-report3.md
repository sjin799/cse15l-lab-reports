# Streamline ssh Configuration

The Goal for this task is to shorten the time to login our ssh account. 
1. ![logon](logIn&.png)
    The first step is to log into your ssh account to esatblish the config file to tell what username is to be used and what server will be login.
    Note: I already set the key code in; therefore, when I login, I used the code already that is already set. 

2. ![create](createfig.png)
    Then we create the config file with vim. 

3. ![config](configcodes.png)
    We established what username and sever the ieng 6 is corresponding to in the configfile. After we are done with that, we will exit the file by using :wq. 

4. ![login](sshieng6.png)
    Then we can login the ssh by just using command `shh ieng6` without all extra work!
