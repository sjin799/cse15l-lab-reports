If you are a window user, please download [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)
Then, look up your personal course account for CSE15L on this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Once you find your account, open the terminal in VSCode and type $ssh cs15lwi22<your_special_pin>@ieng6.ucsd.edu. 
Type yes when you see the message that says the account can't be established, then give your password. You will see this message after login.
